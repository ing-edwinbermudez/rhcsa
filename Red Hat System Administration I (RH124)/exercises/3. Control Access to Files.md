✅ **Task 1:**  

Create the `techdocs` collaborative directory under the `/home` directory. Set the group ownership of the directory to the techdocs group, grant full permissions to user and group, and configure the directory so that only file owners can delete their files.

```bash
mkdir /home/techdocs
ls -ld /home/techdocs/
chown -R :techdocs /home/techdocs/
chmod 1770 /home/techdocs/           #chmod o+t /home/techdocs
ls -ld /home/techdocs
```
✅ **Task 2:** 
Verify that users in the `techdocs` group can create and collaborate on files in the `/home/techdocs` directory. As the `dev1` user, create the `techdoc1.txt` file in the `/home/techdocs` directory. As the dev2 user, add the following content to the file: This is the first tech doc. Configure the necessary group ownership and permissions to allow this collaboration.

```bash
id dev2
# uid=1004(dev2) gid=1004(dev2) groups=1004(dev2),40000(techdocs)
id dev1
# uid=1003(dev1) gid=1003(dev1) groups=1003(dev1),40000(techdocs)
sudo su - dev1
touch /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
chown :techdocs /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
chmod g+w /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
ls -l /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
exit 
sudo su - dev2
echo "This is the first tech doc" >> /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
cat /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
```

✅ **Task 3:**

Verify that only the owner of the `techdoc1.txt` file can remove it. As a nonowning user, attempt to delete the file. Then, switch to the owner, back up the file, and then delete it. Finally, restore the original file from the backup by moving the file.

```bash
sudo su - dev2
rm techdoc1.txt
exit
sudo su - dev1
cp -pr techdoc1.txt techdoc1.txt.bkp
rm techdoc1.txt
mv techdoc1.txt.bkp techdoc1.txt
```

✅ **Task 4:**

In the `/home/techdocs` directory, create subdirectories for the dev1 and dev2 users based on the following table.

Modify permissions so that only the owner can write to the files and directories, the `techdocs` group can read them, and others have no access. Adjust ownerships and permissions accordingly, and verify that new files follow these access rules.

| Owner | Directory | Group    | Files                        |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| dev1  | dev1      | techdocs | dev1.txt, dev1.log, dev1.cfg |
| dev2  | dev2      | techdocs | dev2.txt, dev2.log, dev2.cfg |

```bash
mkdir /home/techdocs/{dev1,dev2}
cd /home/techdocs
ls -ld 
chown dev1:techdocs dev1/
chown dev2:techdocs dev2/
chmod 0750 dev1/ dev2/
umask 027
touch dev1/dev1.{txt,log,cfg} dev2/dev2{txt,log,cfg}
chown -R dev2:techdocs dev2/
chown -R dev1:techdocs dev1/
echo 'File owned by the dev1 user' > dev1/dev1.txt
cat dev1/dev1.txt
echo 'File owned by the dev2 user' > dev2/dev2.txt
cat dev2/dev2.txt
ls -lR
```

✅ **Task 5:**

Verify that a user in the techdocs group who is not the file owner can read file contents in the /home/techdocs collaborative directory. As the editor1 user, read files that are owned by other users in the techdocs group.

```bash
su - editor1
cd /home/techdocs/
tree -ug
cat techdoc1.txt
cat dev1/dev1.txt
cat dev2/dev2.txt
```


✅ **Task 6:**

Verify that only users in the techdocs group can access the `/home/techdocs` collaborative directory. As the `dbadmin1` user, try to access the `/home/techdocs` directory.

```bash
su - dbadmin1
ls -l /home/techdocs/
```
