# ðŸ§­ What Is vim?
vim (Vi IMproved) is an advanced command-line text editor built for speed and efficiency. Itâ€™s an improved version of vi, and it's standard on almost all Unix-like systems, including RHEL.

## Vim Basics: How It Works

Vim has modes â€” thatâ€™s what makes it different:

| Mode        | Purpose                              | How to Enter               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| **Normal**  | Navigate and run commands            | Press `Esc`                |
| **Insert**  | Type and edit text                   | Press `i`                  |
| **Visual**  | Select text to copy/delete/etc.      | Press `v`                  |
| **Command** | Run commands like save, quit, search | Press `:` from Normal mode |


Open a file


```bash
vim filename.md
```
