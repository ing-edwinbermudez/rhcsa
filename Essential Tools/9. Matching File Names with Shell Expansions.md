# Matching File Names with Shell Expansions

## Command-line Expansions

When you type a command at the Bash shell prompt, the shell processes that command line through multiple expansions before running it. You can use these shell expansions to perform complex tasks that would otherwise be difficult or impossible.

The Bash shell performs the following expansions:
- Pathname expansion, which helps to select one or more files by pattern matching.
- Brace expansion, which can generate multiple strings of characters.
- Tilde expansion, which expand to a path to a user home directory.
- Variable expansion, which replaces text with the value that is stored in a shell variable.
- Command substitution, which replaces text with the output of a command.


### Pathname expansion

Pathname expansion, historically called globbing, is one of the most useful features of Bash. Pathname expansion uses wildcards, which are metacharacters that expand to match the file and path names that you are looking for. As a result, commands can act on a focused set of files during a single execution. This feature helps system administrators to manage many files.

Pathname expansion expands a pattern of special characters that represent wildcards or classes of characters into a list of file names that match the pattern. Before the shell runs your command, it replaces the pattern with the list of file names that match. If the pattern does not match anything, then the shell tries to use the pattern as a literal argument for the command that it runs.

The following table lists common metacharacters and pattern classes that are used for pattern matching.


### Table 7.1: Metacharacters and Their Matches

| Pattern           | Matches                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `*`              | Any string of zero or more characters                                   |
| `?`              | Any single character                                                    |
| `[abc…]`         | Any one character in the enclosed class (between the square brackets)   |
| `[!abc…]`        | Any one character **not** in the enclosed class                         |
| `[^abc…]`        | Any one character **not** in the enclosed class (alternative to `!`)    |
| `[[:alpha:]]`    | Any alphabetic character (`A–Z`, `a–z`)                                 |
| `[[:lower:]]`    | Any lowercase alphabetic character (`a–z`)                              |
| `[[:upper:]]`    | Any uppercase alphabetic character (`A–Z`)                              |
| `[[:alnum:]]`    | Any alphabetic character or digit (`A–Z`, `a–z`, `0–9`)                  |
| `[[:punct:]]`    | Any printable punctuation character (not space or alphanumeric)         |
| `[[:digit:]]`    | Any single digit from `0` to `9`                                        |
| `[[:space:]]`    | Any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, carriage return, etc.)   |
