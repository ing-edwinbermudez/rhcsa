uid=UID(username) gid=GID(groupname) groups=GID(groupname)[, GID2(groupname2)]

```
cat /etc/passwd
```

```
id root
grep -i root /etc/passwd
```

#### `uid=UID(username)`
The User ID (UID) uniquely identifies a user on the system.
Example: uid=0(root) means the user is the root (administrator), while uid=5(games) is a system-level user for game-related tasks.

##### `gid=GID(groupname)`
The Group ID (GID) indicates the user's primary group.
This group determines file permissions for files created by the user.

#### `groups=GID(groupname)`
Lists all additional groups the user belongs to.
Group membership defines access to shared files and system resources.


##  <span style="color:red">Group</span> 

```
cat /etc/group
```
___
**Example:**

![alt text](images/image.png)
____

- **`group_name`**  
  The name of the group (e.g., `sudo`, `games`, `developers`).

- **`password`**  
  Optional and rarely used. Usually `x` to indicate that the password is stored in `/etc/gshadow`.

- **`GID` (Group ID)**  
  A numeric ID that uniquely identifies the group (e.g., `0` for `root`, `60` for `games`).

- **`user_list`**  
  A comma-separated list of users who are **members of the group**, aside from the user whose primary group it is.


##  <span style="color:red">Account Types</span>



#### User Account
Regular user accounts used for interactive logins and daily tasks.

**Examples:**
- Edwin
- Camilo

These users typically have limited privileges and belong to one or more groups.

#### Superuser Account

The superuser (also known as **root**) has full access to the system.

- **Username:** `root`
- **UID:** `0`

Used for administrative tasks such as managing users, installing packages, modifying system configuration, and more.


#### System Accounts

Non-login accounts used by the system or software packages.

- Typically have **UIDs < 100** (on Debian/Ubuntu) or **UIDs < 500** (on older Red Hat-based systems).
- Examples: `daemon`, `bin`, `games`, `mail`

These accounts are used to run system services and processes in an isolated and secure way.


#### Service Accounts


Special-purpose accounts created to run background services or daemons.

- Often created during software installation (e.g., `nginx`, `mysql`, `postgres`)
- Usually **have no login shell** (`/usr/sbin/nologin`) to prevent direct access.
- Provide **separation of privileges** for individual services.

**Commands**

```
id
```
`id` Displays the current user's UID, GID, and group memberships.


```
who 
```
`who` Shows who is currently logged into the system.


``` 
last
```

`last` Displays the login history of users (from /var/log/wtmp).


##  <span style="color:red">Switching User </span> 
You can switch users or run commands as another user using the following commands:

```bash
su -
sudo su -
su -c "whoami"

```
To check or configure which users can run commands as root, you can view the sudoers file:

```bash
cat /etc/sudoers
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Edit /etc/sudoers safely using visudo to prevent syntax errors that could lock you out of administrative access

##### üîê `sudo` ‚Äì Granting Privileges with `/etc/sudoers`

The `/etc/sudoers` file controls **who can run commands as another user (typically root)**.  
Each rule defines what actions a user or group can perform with `sudo`.

#### üìò Field Breakdown

| Field            | Description                                       | Example                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **1. User/Group**| The user or group being granted permission        | `bob`, `%sudo`                  |
| **2. Hosts**     | On which host(s) the rule applies                 | `localhost`, `ALL` (default)    |
| **3. RunAs User**| The user(s) the command can be run as             | `ALL` (default: any user)       |
| **4. Command**   | Which command(s) can be executed                  | `/bin/ls`, `ALL` (unrestricted) |

---

#### üìÇ Example Entries
The user `root` can run any command, on any host, as any user and group.
```bash
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
Any user in the `sudo` group can execute any command as any user.
```bash
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

The user `bob` has full sudo privileges.
```bash
bob     ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```

The user `sarah` can only reboot the system using the specified command, and only on `localhost`.
```bash
sarah   localhost=/usr/bin/shutdown -r now
```


##  <span style="color:red">Use System Documentation</span>  
Linux provides built-in tools to access help and manual pages for nearly all commands.

#### üîπ `--help` Option

```bash
ls --help
journalctl --help
```


### üîπ `man` 

The `man` command provides detailed documentation for commands, system calls, configuration files, and more.

```bash
man ls
man journalctl
```

`mandb`

```bash
 sudo mandb
```

* Purpose: Updates the manual page index database.
* Useful after installing new software or adding custom man pages.
* Requires sudo because it writes to system-wide directories (like /var/cache/man).

`apropos`

**üßæ What is apropos?**

The apropos command searches the man pages for keywords related to what you're looking for. It gives you a list of man page entries (from all sections) that match your search term.

Think of it like a "man page search engine."

```bash
 apropos director
```
* Purpose: Searches the manual page descriptions for the keyword "director".
* Displays a list of all commands and topics that mention "director" in their short man descriptions.
* üß† Think of apropos as a man page search engine.

## üìÇ Exploring Documentation: `cd /usr/share/doc`

```bash
cd /usr/share/doc
ls
```

* This command navigates to the system documentation directory.
* Located at /usr/share/doc, it contains text files, changelogs, and READMEs for installed packages.

Inside each folder, you may find:

* README ‚Äì Introduction or usage notes

* changelog.gz ‚Äì Changes made in each version

* copyright ‚Äì Licensing information

* examples/ ‚Äì Sample configuration files

## What are "man pages"?

Man pages (manual pages) are the official documentation for most commands, programs, system calls, and configuration files on Unix/Linux systems. You view them using the man command.

#### **Manual Sections Overview**

Man pages are organized into numbered sections, each covering a different type of content.


###  **Common Sections of the Linux Manual**

| Section | Content type                                 | Description                                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1       | User commands                                | Both executable and shell programs              |
| 2       | System calls                                 | Kernel routines that are invoked from user space|
| 3       | Library functions                            | Provided by program libraries                   |

## `whereis`

The `whereis` command in Linux is used to locate the binary, source, and manual pages for a given command. It performs a quick lookup using predefined paths rather than doing a deep filesystem search (like find or locate).

```bash
whereis [options] command_name
```

**‚öôÔ∏è Common Options**

| Option           | Description                                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-b`             | Search for binaries only                                        |
| `-m`             | Search for manual sections only                                 |
| `-s`             | Search for sources only                                         |
| `-u`             | Show files that have unusual entries                            |
| `-B`, `-M`, `-S` | Specify custom search paths for binaries, man pages, or sources |

```bash
whereis bash
```
