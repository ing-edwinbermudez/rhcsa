# Lab: Mount File Systems and Find Files

**Specifications**

As a system administrator, you are tasked to configure the necessary storage that the applications team requested. Before allowing the applications team to access the server, you must mount the data partition. Additionally, you must use command-line tools to gather file information to confirm that the machine is configured and ready for delegation.

Perform the following tasks on the serverb machine:

```bash
ssh student@serverb
sudo -i
```

- Identify the unused, unmounted block device that contains an XFS file system on the `serverb` machine. Mount the block device on the `/review5-disk` directory.

```bash
lsblk
lsblk -fp
mkdir /review5-disk /review5-disk

# mount /dev/sdb1 /review5-disk
mount UUID="df45e9e4-ac8c-4608-98b7-6d7cee7dc651" /review5-disk
lsblk -fp
df -h

##persitent disk
echo "UUID=df45e9e4-ac8c-4608-98b7-6d7cee7dc651       /review5-disk  xfs  defaults    0       0" >> /etc/fstab 

```

- Find the `review5-path` file. Create the `/review5-disk/review5-path.txt` file that contains a single line with the absolute path to the `review5-path` file.

```bash
find / -iname review5-path 2>/dev/null > /review5-disk/review5-path.txt
cat /review5-disk/review5-path.txt
```

- Find all the files with the `640` octal permissions, and that are owned by the `contractor1` user and the contractor group. Save the list of these files in the `/review5-disk/review5-perms.txt` file.

```bash
find / -user contractor1 -group contractor -perm 640 2>/dev/null > /review5-disk/review5-perms.txt
cat /review5-disk/review5-perms.txt
```

- Find all files with a size of `100 bytes`. Save the absolute paths of these files in the `/review5-disk/review5-size.txt` file.

```bash
find / -type f -size 100c 2>/dev/null > /review5-disk/review5-size.txt
cat /review5-disk/review5-size.txt
```
