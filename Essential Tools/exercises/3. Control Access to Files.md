✅ **Task 1:**  

Create the `techdocs` collaborative directory under the `/home` directory. Set the group ownership of the directory to the techdocs group, grant full permissions to user and group, and configure the directory so that only file owners can delete their files.

```bash
mkdir /home/techdocs
ls -ld /home/techdocs/
chown -R :techdocs /home/techdocs/
chmod 1770 /home/techdocs/           #chmod o+t /home/techdocs
ls -ld /home/techdocs
```
✅ **Task 2:** 
Verify that users in the `techdocs` group can create and collaborate on files in the `/home/techdocs` directory. As the `dev1` user, create the `techdoc1.txt` file in the `/home/techdocs` directory. As the dev2 user, add the following content to the file: This is the first tech doc. Configure the necessary group ownership and permissions to allow this collaboration.

```bash
id dev2
# uid=1004(dev2) gid=1004(dev2) groups=1004(dev2),40000(techdocs)
id dev1
# uid=1003(dev1) gid=1003(dev1) groups=1003(dev1),40000(techdocs)
sudo su - dev1
touch /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
chown :techdocs /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
chmod g+w /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
ls -l /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
exit 
sudo su - dev2
echo "This is the first tech doc" >> /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
cat /home/techdocs/techdoc1.txt
```

✅ **Task 3:**

Verify that only the owner of the `techdoc1.txt` file can remove it. As a nonowning user, attempt to delete the file. Then, switch to the owner, back up the file, and then delete it. Finally, restore the original file from the backup by moving the file.

```bash
sudo su - dev2
rm techdoc1.txt
exit
sudo su - dev1
cp -pr techdoc1.txt techdoc1.txt_backup
rm techdoc1.txt
mv techdoc1.txt.bkp techdoc1.txt
```
