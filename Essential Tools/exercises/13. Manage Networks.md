#Lab: Manage Networks

Specifications

As a system administrator, you are tasked to configure network settings and the hostname on a newly provisioned machine. Completing the network configuration of a server is a prerequisite to delegate the machine to developers and application users to set up and test their applications.

Perform the following tasks on the serverb machine:

```bash
ssh student@serverb
```

- Find the unused network device and use it to create and activate a `static` connection profile. Configure the `static` profile to statically set network settings and not to use DHCP. Use the information from the following table for other connection settings:

| Parameter     | Setting           |
|---------------|-------------------|
| IPv4 address  | 172.25.250.111    |
| Netmask       | 255.255.255.0     |
| Gateway       | 172.25.250.254    |
| DNS Server    | 172.25.250.254    |

```bash
sudo -i
nmcli dev status
nmcli conn show
nmcli dev show 'Wired connection 1'
nmcli connection modify Wired\ connection\ 1 con-name static ifname ens4 type ethernet ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 172.25.250.111/24 ipv4.dns 172.25.250.254 ipv4.gateway 172.25.250.254

nmcli connection up static
```

- Set the hostname to `server-review4.lab4.example.com`.

```bash
hostnamectl hostname server-review4.lab4.example.com
```

- Set client-review4 as the canonical hostname for the servera `172.25.250.10` IPv4 address.

```bash
sudo -i
echo "172.25.250.10 client-review4" >> /etc/hosts
cat /etc/hosts
```

- Configure the `static` connection profile with an additional IPv4 address of `172.25.250.211` with a netmask of `255.255.255.0.` Do not remove the existing IPv4 address. Ensure that the serverb machine responds to all addresses when the static connection is active.

```bash
sudo -i
nmcli connection modify static +ipv4.addresses 172.25.250.211/24
nmcli -f ipv4.addresses conn show static
nmcli conn up static

# servera
ssh student@servera
ping -c 3 172.25.250.211
ping -c 3 172.25.250.111
```
