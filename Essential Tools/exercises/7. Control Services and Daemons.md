# Control Services and Daemons

✅ **Task 1:** 

Log in to the serverb machine as the student user, and switch to the root user. On the serverb machine, start the psacct service.

```bash
ssh student@serverb
sudo -i
systemctl status psacct
```

✅ **Task 2:** 

Verify the current status of the psacct service. If the psacct service is stopped, then start it.

```bash
systemctl status psacct
systemctl start psacct
systemctl is-active psacct
```

✅ **Task 3:** 

Configure the psacct service to start at system boot.

```bash
systemctl enable psacct
systemctl is-enabled psacct
```


✅ **Task 4:** 
Check the status of the rsyslog service. If the rsyslog service is running, then stop the service and verify that it is no longer active.

```bash
systemctl status rsyslog
systemctl stop rsyslog
systemctl is-active rsyslog
```

✅ **Task 5:** 
Configure the rsyslog service so that it does not start at system boot.

```bash
systemctl disable rsyslog
systemctl is-enabled rsyslog
```

✅ **Task 6:**
Reboot the serverb machine so that the boot configuration for the services take effect. Wait for the machine to boot before evaluating this activity.

The machine might take a few minutes to boot.

```bash
systemctl reboot
```
