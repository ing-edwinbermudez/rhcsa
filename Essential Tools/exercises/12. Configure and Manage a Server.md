# Configure and Manage a Server

---
Specifications

As a system administrator, you are tasked to commission, manage, and support developers who use RHEL 10 servers. The system administration team recently provisioned a machine and shared a list of users and directories to log in and manage servers. To avoid sharing passwords, you must configure secure key-based authentication. You must also configure a custom repository and ensure that common system administration tools are installed.


Perform the following tasks on the serverb machine:

```bash
ssh student@serverb
```

- Generate an SSH key pair for the student user. Do not protect the private key with a passphrase. Save the private key as the `/home/student/.ssh/review3_key` file, and save the public key as the `/home/student/.ssh/review3_key.pub` file.

```bash
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/review3_key
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/review3_key.pub student@servera
ssh -i /home/student/.ssh/review3_key student@servera
```

- Configure SSH to prevent the root user from logging in.

```bash
sudo -i
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
    PasswordAuthentication no

systemctl restart sshd.service
```
- Configure SSH so that users log in by using key-based authentication and not by password-based authentication.

```bash
sudo -i
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    PasswordAuthentication no

systemctl restart sshd.service
```

- Configure DNF to get packages from http://repo.example.com/rhel10.0/x86_64/rhcsa-practice/errata. Disable GPG checking for this repository.


```bash

```

- Install the zsh and rht-system packages.


- The student user on the serverb machine must be able to log in to the servera machine by using the review3_key.pub SSH key.
