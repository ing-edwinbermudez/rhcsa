| Find by permission               | `find . -perm 644`                      |
| Find files owned by user         | `find . -user edwin`                    |

### 🧪 Search in multiple directories

```bash
find /var /tmp -name "*.log"
```

### ⚙️ Advanced Usage

Delete found files (⚠️ Use with caution!)

```bash
find . -name "*.tmp" -delete
```

Execute a command on each file
```bash
find . -name "*.log" -exec rm -f {} \;
```
- `{}` is replaced with each found file
- `\`; ends the -exec clause

Combine criteria with and / or
```bash
find . -type f \( -name "*.log" -o -name "*.bak" \)
```

### 📎 Tips
- . means current directory
- Use sudo if you get permission denied errors
- Use quotes to prevent wildcard expansion by the shell
