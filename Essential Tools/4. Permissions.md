## Change Group

The `chgrp` command in Linux is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.

```bash
chgrp [options] <group> <file>
```
```bash
chgrp root script.sh
```

#### Change group of a directory recursively
```bash
chgrp -R admin /var/www
```

##### üß™ Check Current Group Ownership
```bash
ls -l filename
```
#### **üîí Permissions Note**
You must be root (sudo) to change ownership to another user.
- You must be owner of the file or have sudo privileges to change the group.
- You can only change to a group you are a member of (unless you're root).

## Change Owner
he `chown` command in Linux is used to change the owner and/or group of a file or directory.

```bash
chown [options] [owner][:group] <file>
```
- owner: new user to own the file
- group: new group to own the file (optional, separated by : or .)
- file: target file or directory


##### Change only the owner

```bash
chown root script.sh
```

#### Change owner and group:
```bash
chown edwin:developers script.sh
```

#### Change only the group (you can also use chgrp for this)
```bash
chown :developer file.txt
```

##### Recursive change (including all contents of a directory):
```bash
chown -R edwin:developers /project
```

##### **üîí Permissions Note**
- You must be root (sudo) to change ownership to another user.

## File and Directory Permissions

```
