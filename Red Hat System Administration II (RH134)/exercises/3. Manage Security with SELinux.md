#  Lab: Manage Security with SELinux

✅ **Task 1:**

Log in to the serverb machine as the student user and switch to the root user. Use student as the password.

```bash
ssh student@serverb
sudo -i
```

✅ **Task 2:**

From a web browser on the workstation machine, view the http://serverb/lab.html web page. You see the error message: You do not have permission to access this resource.

```bash
curl http://serverb/lab.html
```

✅ **Task 3:**

Research and identify the SELinux issue that prevents the Apache service from serving web content.

```bash
less /var/log/messages
    /sealert
sealert -l e20dc831-2a2e-468e-bda6-9c5f321b4cc0
ausearch -m AVC -ts today
```

✅ **Task 4:**

Display the SELinux context of the new HTTP document directory and the original HTTP document directory. Resolve the SELinux issue that prevents the Apache server from serving web content.

```bash
ls -dZ /lab-content /var/www/html
semanage fcontent -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/lab-content(/.*)?'
restorecon -Rv /lab-content/
ls -dZ /lab-content /var/www/html
```

✅ **Task 5:**

Verify that the Apache server can now serve web content on the workstation machine.

```bash
curl http://serverb/lab.html
```
