# Lab: Analyze and Store Logs

```bash
ssh student@serverb
```

✅ **Task 1:**

Pretend that the serverb machine is relocated to Jamaica and that you must update to the America/Jamaica time zone. Elevate the privileges of the student user to run the `timedatectl` command to update the time zone. Use student as the password.

Verify that you correctly set the appropriate time zone.

```bash
sudo -i
tzselect
timedatectl set-timezone America/Jamaica
```

✅ **Task 2:**

View the recorded log events in the previous 30 minutes.

```bash
sudo -i
journalctl -S "-30min"

```
