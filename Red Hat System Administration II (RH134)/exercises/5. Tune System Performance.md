# Lab Tune System Performance

✅ **Task 1:**

Change the current tuning profile for the `serverb` machine to the balanced profile, which is a general tuned profile. Then, list the information for the `balanced` tuning profile

```bash
ssh student@serverb
dnf list tuned
systemctl is-enabled tuned
systemctl is-actived tuned

tuned-adm list
sudo tuned-adm profile balanced
sudo tuned-adm profile_info
``` 

✅ **Task 2:**

Two processes on the `serverb` machine are consuming a high percentage of CPU time. Adjust the nice value of each of the two processes to 10 to allow more CPU time for other processes.

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 4
ps aux --sort=pcpu
ps -o pid,pcpu,nice,comm $(pgrep sha1sum;pgrep md5sum)
sudo renice -n 10 1875 1872
ps -o pid,pcpu,nice,comm $(pgrep sha1sum;pgrep md5sum)
```
