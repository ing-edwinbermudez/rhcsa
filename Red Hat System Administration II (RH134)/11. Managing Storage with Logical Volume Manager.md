# Creating Logical Volumes
---

## Logical Volume Manager Overview

Use the LVM system to create logical storage volumes as a layer on the physical storage. This storage system provides greater flexibility than using physical storage directly. LVM hides the hardware storage configuration from the software, and enables you to resize volumes without stopping applications or unmounting file systems. LVM provides comprehensive command-line tools to manage storage.

### Physical devices

Logical volumes use physical devices for storing data. These devices might be disk partitions, whole disks, Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) devices, or Storage Area Networks (SAN) disks. You must initialize a device as an LVM physical volume. An LVM physical volume must use the entire physical device.

### Physical Volumes (PVs)

LVM uses the underlying physical device as the LVM physical volume. LVM tools segment the physical volumes into physical extents (PEs) to form small chunks of data that act as the smallest storage block on a PV.

### Volume Groups (VGs)

A volume group is a storage pool that is made from one or more PVs. It is the functional equivalent of a whole disk in physical storage. A PV must be allocated only to a single VG. LVM sets the PE size automatically, although it is possible to specify it. A VG might consist of unused space and several logical volumes.

### Logical Volumes (LVs)

Logical volumes are created from free physical extents in a VG, and are provided as the storage device for applications, users, and operating systems. LVs are a collection of logical extents (LEs), which map to physical extents. By default, each LE is mapped to one PE. Setting specific LV options changes this mapping; for example, mirroring causes each LE to map to two PEs.

Logical Volume Manager Workflow
- Creating LVM storage requires building structures in a logical workflow.
- Determine the physical devices to become physical volumes, and initialize these devices as LVM physical volumes.
- Create a volume group from multiple physical volumes.
- Create the logical volumes from the available space in the volume group.
- Format the logical volume with a file system and mount it, or activate it as swap space, or pass the raw volume to a database or storage server for advanced structures.

<b>Note:</b><br><br>
The examples here use the /dev/sdb device name and its storage partitions. The device names on your classroom system might be different. Use the lsblk, blkid, or cat /proc/partitions commands to identify your system's devices.<br><br>

## Build LVM Storage

Creating a logical volume involves creating physical device partitions, physical volumes, and volume groups. After creating an LV, format the volume and mount it to access it as storage.

## Prepare Physical Devices

<div style="border: 1px solid #aaa; border-radius: 6px; padding: 12px; background: #020202ff;">
<b>Note:</b><br><br>
Partitioning is optional. You can use the whole raw physical device as a physical volume.<br><br></div>



Use the `parted` command to label the partition.

```bash
parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt mkpart primary 1MiB 769MiB
```

Use the `parted` command to create a partition on the physical device.

```bash
parted /dev/sdb mkpart secondary 770MiB 1026MiB
```

Set the first partition to the Linux LVM partition type.

```bash
parted /dev/sdb set 1 lvm on
```

Set the second partition to the Linux LVM partition type.

```bash
parted /dev/sdb set 2 lvm on
```

Use the `udevadm settle` command to register the new partition with the kernel.

```bash
udevadm settle
```

## Create Physical Volumes

Use the `pvcreate` command to label the physical partition as an LVM physical volume. Label multiple devices simultaneously by using space-delimited device names as arguments to the `pvcreate` command.

This example labels the `/dev/sdb1` and `/dev/sdb2` devices as PVs that are ready for creating volume groups.

```bash
pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2
```

## Create a Volume Group

The `vgcreate` command builds one or more physical volumes into a volume group. The first argument is a volume group name, followed by one or more physical volumes to allocate to this VG

This example creates the `vg01` VG by using the `/dev/sdb1` and `/dev/sdb2` PVs.

```bash
vgcreate vg01 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2
```

## Create a Logical Volume

The `lvcreate` command creates a logical volume from the available PEs in a volume group. Use the `lvcreate` command to set the LV name and size, and the VG name to contain this logical volume.

This example creates the lv01 LV with 300 MiB in the vg01 VG.

```bash
lvcreate -n lv01 -L 300M vg01
```
