# Matching Text with Regular Expressions

## Write Regular Expressions

Regular expressions provide a pattern matching mechanism to find specific content. The grep, less, and vim commands are some of the commands that can use regular expressions.

Programming languages such as C, Python, and Rust also support regular expressions, and might differ slightly in syntax.

Regular expressions are a unique language, with their own syntax and rules. This section introduces regular expression syntax as implemented in Bash, with examples.

## A Simple Regular Expression

The simplest regular expression is an exact match of the string to search. An exact match occurs when the characters in the regular expression match the type and order of the string.

Imagine that a user is looking through the following file for all occurrences of the cat pattern:

```bash
cat
dog
concatenate
dogma
category
educated
boondoggle
vindication
chilidog
```

The cat string is an exact match of the c character, followed by the a and t characters with no other characters in between. Searching the file with the cat string as the regular expression returns the following matches:

```bash
cat
concatenate
category
educated
vindication
```

## Match the Start and End of a Line

A regular expression matches the search string anywhere on the line in which it occurs: at the beginning, middle, or end of the word or line. Use a line anchor metacharacter to control where to look for a match on a line.

To match only at the beginning of a line, use the caret character (^). To match only at the end of a line, use the dollar sign ($).

Using the same file as in the previous example, the `^cat` regular expression matches two lines.

```bash
cat
category
```

The `cat$` regular expression finds only one match, where the cat characters occur at the end of a line.

```bash
cat
```

Locate lines in the file that end with dog by using an end-of-line anchor to create the `dog$` regular expression. This example matches two lines:

```bash
dog
chilidog
```

To locate a line that contains only the exact search expression, use both the beginning and end-of-line anchors. For example, to locate the word cat when it is both at the beginning and at the end of a line simultaneously, use `^cat$`.

```bash
cat
```

## Basic and Extended Regular Expressions

The two types of regular expressions are basic regular expressions and extended regular expressions.

One difference between basic and extended regular expressions is in the behavior of the |, +, ?, (, ), {, and } special characters. In basic regular expression syntax, these characters have a special meaning only if they are prefixed with a backslash \ character. In extended regular expression syntax, it is exactly the opposite: these characters have a special meaning unless they are prefixed with a backslash character.

Other minor differences apply to how the ^, $, and * characters are handled.

The `grep`, `sed`, and `vim` commands use basic regular expressions. The `grep` command `-E` option, the `sed` command -E option, and the `less` command use extended regular expressions.

## Wildcard and Multiplier Usage in Regular Expressions

egular expressions use a period character (.) as a wildcard to match any single character on a single line. The `c.t` regular expression searches for a string that contains `c`, followed by any single character, followed by `t`.
