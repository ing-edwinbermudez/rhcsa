# Creating and Managing File Systems on Standard Partitions

## Disk Partitioning

Disk partitioning divides a hard drive into multiple logical storage partitions. You can use partitions to divide storage based on different requirements, and this division provides many benefits:

- Limit available space to applications or users.
- Separate operating system and program files from user files.
- Create a separate area for memory swapping.
- Limit disk space use to improve the performance of diagnostic tools and backup imaging.

On x86 systems, the two primary partitioning schemes are Master Boot Record (MBR) and GUID Partition Table (GPT).

### Master Boot Record (MBR) Partition Scheme

The Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme is the standard on systems that run Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware. This scheme supports a maximum of four primary partitions. On Linux systems, with extended and logical partitions, you can create up to 15 partitions. With a 32-bit partition size, disks that are partitioned with MBR can have a size of up to 2 TiB.

The 2 TiB disk and partition size limit is now a common and restrictive limitation. Consequently, the legacy MBR scheme is superseded by the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning scheme.

### GUID Partition Table (GPT) Partition Scheme

For systems that run Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware, the GUID Partition Scheme (GPT) is the standard for disk partitioning, and addresses the limitations of the MBR scheme. The GPT scheme provides a maximum of 128 partitions. The GPT scheme allocates 64 bits for logical block addresses to support partitions and disks of up to eight zebibytes (ZiB) or eight billion tebibytes (TiB).

## Managing Partitions

An administrator can use a partition editor program to change a disk's partitions, such as by creating and deleting partitions, and changing partition types.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux provides the `parted` command as the standard command-line partition editor. You can use the parted partition editor with storage that uses either the MBR partitioning scheme or the GPT partitioning scheme.

The `parted` command takes as its first argument the device name that represents the entire storage device or disk to modify, followed by subcommands.

The following example uses the print subcommand to display the partition table on the disk that is the `/dev/sda` block device (the first QEMU disk that the system detects):

```bash
parted /dev/sda print
```

To start an interactive session, execute the `parted` command as 
the `root` user and specify the disk device name as an argument:

```bash
parted /dev/sda
```

Use the `print` subcommand to display the partition table:

```bash
print
```

To exit the interactive partitioning session, use the quit command:

```bash
quit
```


By default, the parted command displays sizes in powers of 10 (KB, MB, GB). You can change the unit size with the unit parameter, which accepts the following values:

- s for sector
- B for byte
- MiB, GiB, or TiB (powers of 2)
- MB, GB, or TB (powers of 10)
