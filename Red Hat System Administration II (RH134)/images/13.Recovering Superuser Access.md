# Regaining Superuser Access and Resetting the Root Password

## Resetting the root Password from the Boot Loader

One task that every system administrator should be able to accomplish is resetting a `root` user's lost password. This task is trivial if the administrator is still logged in, either as the `root` user or as an unprivileged user with full Sudo access. However, this task is a little more complex when the administrator is not logged in because it requires rebooting the system into a special state known as a rescue environment or rescue mode.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10, you can enter rescue mode to change a forgotten root password by using one of two methods:

- With rescue media (recommended)
- Without rescue media

### With Rescue Media

The recommended approach is to use rescue media, which enables you to boot a small Red Hat Enterprise Linux environment from installation media, such as a CD-ROM or an ISO file, instead of from the system's hard drive.

To boot into rescue mode, you must be able to use one of the following installation media devices or files to boot the system:

- For a physical machine, use installation media such an a CD-ROM or a USB flash device.
- For a virtual machine, use ISO files.

When using rescue media, be sure that the image is the same as the system. For example, for a RHEL 10 system, you must use a RHEL 10 image.

As part of the network installation media, Red Hat provides a minimum installation image: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10.0 Boot ISO. You can use this boot ISO image as rescue media to reboot the system and reset the root password.

To use this image as rescue media, follow these steps:

1. Reboot the system.
2. During the system reboot, select the boot.iso image to boot from. The process to select alternate media to boot from varies based on your environment.
3. From the GRUB2 menu, go to Troubleshooting â†’ Rescue a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.

4. In the rescue environment menu, select Continue by pressing 1 and then press Enter to mount the system normally.
