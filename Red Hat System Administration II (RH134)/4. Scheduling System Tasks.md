# Managing Repeating Jobs by Using Systemd Timer Units
---

## Systemd Timer

Starting from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10, the `systemd` daemon and service manager replaces the traditional `cron` daemon for most of the scheduling system tasks, via the `systemd` timer units.

A `systemd` timer unit is defined by a unit configuration file with a file name that ends with `.timer.` Timer units activate a unit of another type, which is usually a service. By default, the unit name matches the timer unit name. Timer units enable timer-based activation of other units and describe when to run another unit. The `systemd` timer unit logs timer events in system journals for ease of debugging.

Note

    Fuller discussion of the systemd timer units is beyond the scope of this section. For more information, see the systemd(1) man page.

## List Timer Units

To list all timer units that are loaded in memory, use the `systemctl list-units` command. This command lists timer units that are active, pending, or failed. You can use the `--all` option to include inactive timer units.

```bash
systemctl list-units -t timer
```

The column headings are as follows:

UNIT
The full name of the unit.

LOAD
Indicates whether the unit definition was loaded.

ACTIVE
Indicates whether the unit is active at a high level.

SUB
Shows the unit-type-specific detailed state of the unit; possible values vary by unit type.

DESCRIPTION
A brief description of the unit's purpose.
